This is my quick and dirty app to connect to my innovate LC1 wideband AFR sensorfrom OTG enabled Android device.

It's not meant to be perfect but it works.

Next (if this project doesn't die) I'll make a simple arduino based device to connect to wideband and OBD and send the combined data over to my phone.
